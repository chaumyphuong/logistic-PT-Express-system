## 2. Executive Summary

PT Express is a logistics and transportation company operating nationwide in Vietnam. The company currently manages delivery orders using Google Sheets and paper-based invoice books.

As order volume increases, the existing manual processes lead to operational inefficiencies, data inconsistencies, and limited transparency for customers and internal staff.

This project proposes the development of a **mobile-based order management application** to digitize core business processes, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer experience.
